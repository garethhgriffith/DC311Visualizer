## Usage
- This project was built with Processing 2.2.1 and can be dowloaded here: [Processing](https://processing.org/)
- Load Mapping.pde and run

## Notes
- Current implementation utilizes Google Maps for the map tiles as the original/screenshot version map API was depricated. If everything seems to work but the map fails to load, the API that brings in the tiles will need to be changed.
